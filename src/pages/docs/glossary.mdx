  title='16. LSD (Liquid Staking):'
  subText="Liquid Staking, also known as Eth2.0 Liquid Staking, is the process of staking Ethereum2.0 (ETH2) tokens while simultaneously maintaining liquidity and accessibility to those tokens. MultichainZ's lending protocol offers the ability to participate in Eth2.0 Liquid Staking by allowing users to stake their ETH2 tokens and borrow against them, enabling them to benefit from staking rewards while having the flexibility to utilize their staked assets."
/>
<br />

<MultiWeightDiv
  title='17. APYs:'
  subText="APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield, and it represents the potential return or earnings on an investment over a one-year period. In the context of MultichainZ's lending protocol, APYs are used to calculate the potential annual returns or rewards that borrowers or liquidity providers can earn by participating in various lending and staking activities within the protocol. APYs can vary based on market conditions, collateral types, and other factors."
/>
<br />

<MultiWeightDiv
  title='18. Collateral:'
  subText="Collateral refers to the assets that borrowers pledge or lock as security when borrowing funds within the lending protocol. These assets provide lenders with a form of guarantee or collateralization, reducing the risk of default. In MultichainZ's lending protocol, various types of assets, including NFTs, real-world assets, and cryptocurrencies, can be used as collateral to secure loans."
/>
<br />

<MultiWeightDiv
  title='19. Liquidation Mechanism:'
  subText="The liquidation mechanism is a component of the lending protocol that automatically triggers the process of seizing and selling collateral assets in the event of a borrower's failure to meet their loan obligations. When the value of the collateral falls below a certain threshold or if there is a significant market fluctuation, the liquidation mechanism ensures the repayment of loans by selling the collateral assets to cover the outstanding debt."
/>
<br />

<MultiWeightDiv
  title='20. Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs):'
  subText='Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) are financial instruments or tokens that represent a derivative form of staked assets in a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network. In PoS systems, participants can lock up or stake their cryptocurrency as collateral to support network consensus and earn staking rewards. LSDs allow staked assets to be tokenized and traded on secondary markets, providing liquidity to stakers who would otherwise have their assets locked for a specific period. These derivatives enable stakers to access the value of their staked assets before the staking period ends, allowing them to participate in other financial activities or investment opportunities. LSDs are designed to provide flexibility and liquidity to stakers while maintaining the security and benefits of the underlying staked assets and PoS network.'

<MultiWeightDiv
  title='21. Bug Bounty:'
  subText='A bug bounty program is a reward-based initiative that encourages individuals to discover and report software vulnerabilities or bugs within a system. MultichainZ may offer a bug bounty program to incentivize users, developers, or security experts to identify and report any potential security issues or vulnerabilities in the lending protocol. Rewards are typically given to those who responsibly disclose such vulnerabilities.'
/>
<br />

<MultiWeightDiv
  title='22. Audit:'
  subText="An audit refers to a comprehensive review and assessment of the lending protocol's codebase, security practices, and smart contracts. Audits are conducted by independent third-party firms or security experts to identify any potential vulnerabilities, bugs, or weaknesses in the protocol's design or implementation. The purpose of an audit is to enhance security, identify potential risks, and ensure the integrity and reliability of the lending protocol."
/>
<br />

<MultiWeightDiv
  title='23. NFT (Non-Fungible Token):'
  subText='A non-fungible token is a digital asset that represents ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content, such as artwork, collectibles, or virtual real estate, using blockchain technology. Unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis due to their uniqueness, making them valuable for digital ownership and provenance.'
/>
<br />

<MultiWeightDiv
  title='24. RWAs (Real World Assets):'
  subText='Real World Assets refer to tangible or intangible assets from the physical world that are represented and tokenized on a blockchain. These assets can include real estate, commodities, precious metals, intellectual property, and more. By tokenizing these assets, they can be easily traded, divided into fractional ownership, and provide increased liquidity and accessibility to investors.'
/>
<br />

<MultiWeightDiv
  title='25. Price Oracle:'
  subText='A price oracle is a system or service that provides reliable and up-to-date price data for assets in decentralized applications (DApps) or smart contracts on a blockchain. Price oracles are crucial for applications that require accurate and timely pricing information, such as decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and prediction markets. They help ensure fair and transparent execution of transactions and enable smart contracts to interact with real-world market prices.'
/>
<br />

<MultiWeightDiv
  title='26. Slashing Risks:'
  subText="Slashing risks refer to potential penalties or punishments that participants in a blockchain network may face for violating the network's rules or engaging in malicious behavior. Slashing can occur in proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain networks when participants are required to lock up or stake their cryptocurrency as collateral to support network consensus. If a participant is found to have acted against the rules, their staked funds may be partially or entirely confiscated (slashed) as a deterrent against misbehaviour."

<br />

<MultiWeightDiv
  title='27. LSDs (Layer-2 Scaling Solutions):'
  subText='Layer-2 scaling solutions are protocols or technologies built on top of existing blockchains, such as Ethereum, to improve scalability and transaction throughput. These solutions aim to alleviate network congestion and high fees by offloading a significant portion of transaction processing to secondary layers or sidechains while maintaining the security and decentralization benefits of the underlying blockchain. Examples of layer-2 scaling solutions include state channels, sidechains, plasma, and rollups.'

<MultiWeightDiv
  title='28. Blockchain:'
  subText='A blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records and stores transactions across multiple computers or nodes. Each transaction is bundled into a block, which is added to the chain in a chronological and immutable manner. The blockchain is secured through cryptography, consensus mechanisms (e.g. proof-of-work or proof-of-stake), and decentralized validation, enabling trust, transparency, and tamper resistance. It has various applications beyond cryptocurrencies, including supply chain management, voting systems, decentralized finance, and more'

  Bug bounties and audits play crucial roles in ensuring the security and
  reliability of the lending protocol. Bug bounty programs incentivize
  individuals to actively search for and report vulnerabilities, helping to
  identify and address potential security risks. Audits provide an additional
  layer of security by subjecting the protocol's codebase, smart contracts, and
  security practices to thorough scrutiny by independent experts.

<FiraText>
  Collateral is the assets provided by borrowers to secure their loans within
  the lending protocol. By pledging collateral, borrowers reduce the risk for
  lenders and enable the borrowing of funds. The lending protocol accepts
  various types of collateral, broadening the options available for
  participants.
