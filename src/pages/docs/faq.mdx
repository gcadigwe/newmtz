  <FiraBold>Why MultiChainZ?</FiraBold>
</CodeBlockTitle>

<FiraText>
  The protocol is entirely open source, enabling individuals to engage with it
  through various means such as a user interface client, API, or direct

  <FiraBold>How can I interact with MultiChainZ?</FiraBold>
</CodeBlockTitle>

<FiraText>
  To interact with MultiChainz, you need to provide the asset and quantity you
  desire. Once you've supplied your assets, you will start earning passive
  income proportional to the borrowing demand in the market. Furthermore, by
  supplying assets, you gain the ability to borrow using your supplied assets as
  collateral. The interest you earn from supplying funds helps counterbalance
  the interest you accumulate from borrowing.

<CodeBlockTitle>
  <FiraBold>How does the lending protocol support NFT lending?</FiraBold>
</CodeBlockTitle>

<FiraText>
  MultichainZ's lending protocol allows users to collateralize their NFT assets
  and borrow against them. By locking their NFTs as collateral, users can access
  liquidity in the form of cryptocurrencies or stablecoins, while still
  maintaining ownership of their NFTs. This opens up new possibilities for NFT
  holders to leverage their assets and access immediate funds without selling
  their NFTs.

    Can real-world assets be used as collateral within the lending protocol?
  </FiraBold>
</CodeBlockTitle>

<FiraText>
  Yes, MultichainZ's lending protocol supports the use of real-world assets as
  collateral. By leveraging blockchain-based tokenization, real-world assets
  such as real estate, art, or commodities can be represented as digital tokens.
  These tokens can then be used as collateral within the lending protocol,
  enabling users to unlock liquidity without selling their physical assets.
