<FiraText>
  MultichainZ presents a comprehensive framework for achieving decentralization
  and autonomy within the MultichainZ Protocol. This framework encompasses
  governance mechanisms and financial incentives, aiming to establish alignment
  among various stakeholders within the MultichainZ ecosystem, protocol
  functionality, and the core securing element, the Chainz token. Detailed
  information can be found here.

<br />

<FiraBold>_Voting Requirements:</FiraBold>
<br />
<FiraText>
  To participate in voting, you must possess Chainz tokens or stkChainz (Staked
  Chainz) tokens. Both types of tokens can be used, and the voting power will be
  calculated based on the combined amount of tokens you hold.

<br />
<FiraText>Note: To ensure the validity of your vote, the balance of your voting tokens must remain the same or higher throughout the entire voting and validation period of the proposal.</FiraText>

<br />

<FiraText fontSize='18px'>_Changing Your Vote</FiraText>

<br />
<FiraText>
  You can easily change your vote by following the aforementioned steps and
  casting your desired vote. Your previous vote will automatically be canceled.
</FiraText>

<br />
<br />

<FiraText fontSize='18px'>_Token Movement during Voting:</FiraText>

<br />
<FiraText>
  You are permitted to move your Chainz tokens, as long as the amount in your
  wallet used for voting remains equal to or higher than the tokens initially
  used for voting. If you reduce your token amount below the voting tokens'
  quantity, your vote will be canceled.
</FiraText>

<br />
<br />

<FiraText fontSize='18px'>_Adding More Tokens to Your Vote:</FiraText>

<br />
<FiraText>
  Yes, you can vote again to reflect your updated token amount.
</FiraText>

<br />
<br />

<FiraText fontSize='18px'>_Voting Mechanism:</FiraText>

<br />
<FiraText>
  For detailed information on the voting process, refer to the 'From Idea to
  Implementation to Execution' post on the Governance forum. If you require a
  more technical explanation, please consult the Governance section of the
  Developer Docs.
</FiraText>

<br />
<br />

<FiraText fontSize='18px'>_Voting Threshold:</FiraText>

<br />
<FiraText>
  The voting threshold is dynamic and can change based on the quorum and the
  differential of votes for or against a MultichainZ Improvement Proposal (MIP).
  If there are only a few votes against an MIP, the threshold remains the same.
  However, if the votes against the MIP are more substantial, the threshold can
  be increased, requiring a higher number of votes in favor for the MIP to pass.
  This ensures that an MIP attains overwhelming approval before implementation.
</FiraText>

<br />
<br />

<FiraText fontSize='18px'>_For example:</FiraText>
<br />
<CodeBlock>
  <FiraText>
    If the quorum is set at 20%, the differential is 15%, and 2% of the total
    votes are against the MIP, the threshold remains at 20% because 15 + 2 = 17,
    which is less than 20. If the quorum is set at 20%, the differential is 15%,
    and 6% of the total votes are against the MIP, the threshold would be raised
    to 21% because 15 + 6 = 21. Consequently, more "yae" votes would be required
    for the MIP to pass.
