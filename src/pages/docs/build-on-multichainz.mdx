We believe that by building on MultichainZ, developers, projects, and DAOs can unlock a world of possibilities, revolutionize cross-chain interoperability, and contribute to the growth of decentralized finance. We are excited to have you join our vibrant community and look forward to seeing the innovative solutions you bring to life on the MultichainZ ecosystem!

We want to ensure that projects building on MultichainZ have the necessary support to thrive. While our grants program is not immediately available, we are actively working towards its launch shortly after the Token Generation Event (TGE). This program will provide eligible projects with an opportunity to claim grants that can significantly support their development efforts on the MultichainZ protocol.
