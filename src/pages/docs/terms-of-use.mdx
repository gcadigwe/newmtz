<br />

<FiraText>
    These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the MultichainZ website (referred to as "MultichainZ.com") and the App.MultichainZ   .com interface (referred to as the “Interface") collectively referred to as the "Services." The Services are provided by MultichainZ ("we," "us," or "our").

MultichainZ.com provides information and resources about the MultichainZ web3.0 lending protocol, which is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol. The protocol consists of open-source self-executing smart contracts deployed on various permissionless public blockchains, including Ethereum (referred to as the "MultichainZ  Protocol" or the "Protocol"). MultichainZ does not control or operate any version of the MultichainZ  Protocol on any blockchain network.

The Interface, hosted on IPFS, is an independent interface that allows users, through their self-custodial wallets, to interact with the MultichainZ Protocol.

ARBITRATION NOTICE: THESE TERMS INCLUDE AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE BELOW. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTES RELATING TO THE SERVICES (AS DEFINED BELOW) WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

While we strive to provide accurate and reliable information, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information provided. It is possible that the information may be outdated or subject to errors or omissions. The codebases of all the versions of the Protocol are maintained on each full network node of the relevant blockchain.

You understand that when you interact with the Protocol, you retain control over your cryptoassets at all times.
Users use third-party self-custodial wallets to interact with the Protocol; we have no control or guarantee over the wallets.

To interact with the Protocol using the Interface, you will need to connect and engage with it through your self-custodial wallet. It's essential to understand that your self-custodial wallet is provided by a third-party entity and is generally governed by separate terms and conditions set by the respective third-party service provider. These terms and conditions may involve additional fees, disclaimers, or risk warnings regarding the accuracy and reliance on the provided information. Reviewing and comprehending the terms and conditions associated with your chosen self-custodial wallet provider to ensure compliance and to be aware of any applicable charges or risks is your sole responsibility.

You acknowledge that we do not have information regarding all Protocol transactions beyond what is available or obtainable publicly via the blockchain. However, we may collect information regarding the users of the Services in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

There may be associated blockchain fees.
Transactions using blockchains may require the payment of gas fees, which are essentially network transaction fees paid on every transaction that occurs on the selected blockchain network. Please note that gas fees are non-refundable. We do not provide any services to users or deliver, hold, and/or receive payment for cryptoassets. We do not receive any fees for any transactions or the Services.

<br />
<br />
<FiraBold>_Risk Assumptions</FiraBold>
<br />
<FiraText>
  You assume the risks of engaging in MultichainZ, a novel and experimental
  technology. Technologies such as smart contracts on multiple blockchains,
  cryptographic tokens generated by these smart contracts, and other emerging
  software, applications, and systems that interact with multichain-based
  networks are experimental, speculative, inherently risky, and subject to
  change. Among other risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattacks, or changes to the
  applicable blockchain (e.g., forks) could disrupt these technologies and even
  result in a total loss of cryptoassets, their market value, or digital funds.
  We assume no liability or responsibility for any such risks. If you are not
  comfortable assuming these risks, you should not access or engage in
  transactions using multichain-based technology.
</FiraText>

<br />
<br />
<FiraBold>_We are not liable for any third-party services or links.</FiraBold>
<br />
<FiraText>
  We are not responsible for the content or services of any third-party,
  including, without limitation, any network or apps like Discord or MetaMask,
  and we make no representations regarding the content or accuracy of any
  third-party services or materials. The use and access of any third-party
  products or services, including through MultichainZ, are at your own risk.
  Please note that we do not have control over third-party services.
  Consequently, we cannot guarantee, endorse, or recommend such content or
  services to users of MultichainZ, nor can we endorse their use for any
  specific purpose.

  _You agree to the automated collection and disbursement of proceeds by smart
  contracts.
</FiraBold>
<br />
<FiraText>
  You acknowledge and agree that all transactions accessed through MultichainZ
  will be automatically processed using one or more smart contracts. By engaging
  in transactions using MultichainZ, you acknowledge and consent to the
  automatic processing of all transactions in connection with using the
  platform. You further acknowledge and agree that the applicable smart contract
  will dictate how the funds of a transaction and ownership of cryptoassets are
  distributed.
</FiraText>
<br />
<br />
<FiraBold>_You acknowledge the risks of using MultichainZ.</FiraBold>
<br />
<FiraText>
  You bear sole responsibility for evaluating MultichainZ before using it, and
  all transactions on the multichain are irreversible, final, and without
  refunds. The platform may be disabled, disrupted, or adversely impacted as a
  result of sophisticated cyber-attacks, surges in activity, computer viruses,
  and/or other operational or technical challenges, among other things. We
  disclaim any ongoing obligation to notify you of all the potential risks of
  using and accessing MultichainZ. You agree to accept these risks and agree
  that you will not seek to hold any MultichainZ Company Indemnified Party
  responsible for any consequent losses.

<br />
<br />
<FiraBold>
  _You are solely responsible for the security of your self-custodial wallet.
</FiraBold>
<br />
<FiraText>
  You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining the
  security of your self-custodial wallet within MultichainZ. You alone are
  responsible for securing your private keys. We do not have access to your
  private keys. Any unauthorized access to your self-custodial wallet by third
  parties could result in the loss or theft of any cryptoasset or funds held in
  your account and any associated accounts. You understand and agree that we
  have no involvement in, and you will not hold us responsible for managing and
  maintaining the security of your self-custodial wallet. The private key
  associated with the self-custodial wallet address from which you transfer
  cryptoassets or the private key associated is the only private key that can
  control the cryptoassets you transfer into the smart contracts.
