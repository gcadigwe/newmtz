<FiraBold>_Foreword</FiraBold>
<br />
<FiraText>
  In recent years, tokenized currencies have disrupted the financial markets by
  introducing an alternative efficient way of transferring and storing economic
  value. Striving to take advantage of this technology to provide value to the
  community, Multichainz has a native token that will power its financial
  services. Multichainz acknowledges that the potential of tokens goes beyond
  just being a digital asset. With the advent of blockchain benefits, tokens can
  facilitate the creation of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that
  allow for democratic decision-making and community ownership. To facilitate
  this, Multichainz introduces a new token (CHAINZ), which powers its DAO
  community, serves as a utility token to pay for protocol transaction fees, and
  facilitates access to Multichainz lending, borrowing, and staking services.
  CHAINZ will be available across multiple blockchains, enabling broader access
  to users and integration with other projects. This multi-chain token will play
  a significant role in the ecosystem development of the protocol, enabling
  seamless and frictionless transactions between community members and
  stakeholders. Additionally, it will facilitate strategic support and promotion
  of shared interests from relevant stakeholders allowing forthe long-term
  success ofthe product. This paper will delve into the CHAINZ tokenomics.
  First, it examines how the token will be distributed. Then, it explains how
  the token will facilitate economic incentives to ensure the stability and
  growth of the protocol. The main aim is to provide a comprehensive
  understanding ofthe token, its role within the ecosystem, and how it will
  contribute to the development ofthe blockchain lending sector.

<FiraBold>_Token Allocation</FiraBold>
<br />
<FiraText>
  The distribution of tokens is a critical aspect of any blockchain project, as
  it determines the project's success or failure. Multichainz acknowledges that
  the initial allocation of tokens and the ongoing distribution mechanisms can
  have a significant impact on the token's value, adoption, and overall network
  effects. Multichainz’s goal is to ensure a fair and equitable allocation of
  tokens to all stakeholders while incentivizing participation and ecosystem
  growth contribution of community members. The token allocation will help
  Multichainz to build a strong and engaged community of users and relevant
  stakeholders. Thus, the Multichainz token will have the following distribution
  chart:

  <FiraBold>_Token Sale Procedure</FiraBold>
  <br />
  <FiraText>_Overview</FiraText>
  <br />
  <FiraText>
    Multichainz, through its incubator AS Labs based in Singapore, will conduct
    a token sale procedure that comprises a multi-stage token sale to raise
    funds for its further development. The token sale procedure will be crucial
    in ensuring long-term ecosystem success and will allow Multichainz to scale
    decentralized tokenized asset lending to institutions and retail users.
    Multichainz will ensure that the fundraising procedure is transparent and
    compliant with regulatory requirements. The raised funds will be allocated
    to research and development, marketing and adoption, liquidity provision,
    partner acquisition, security enhancements, and technical development. The
    token involved in the sale will be a native governance token that will allow
    stakeholders to vote on ecosystem decisions and a utility one that allows
    holders to pay for Multichainz protocol transactions and more relevantly,
    access protocol-exclusive opportunities.

  <FiraText>_Fundraising Details</FiraText>
  <br />
  <FiraText>
    Multichainz’s fundraising process will be conducted via a staged ordered
    sale, whereby each fundraising stage will be conducted in the following
    order: Seed/Lead, Angels/KOLs, Private, Discord, Twitter, BSC Community, and
    Public. Following this order will ensure the appropriate and timely
    attraction and retention of different investors, development partners, and
    community members. The funds obtained through the fundraising will be
    destinated to ecosystem development; it will allow the founding team can
    guide Multichainz to meeting its goal of providing a tokenized real-world
    asset lending platform to institutions. The process of fundraising for
    investors will entail signing a “Simple Agreements for Future Tokens”
    (SAFTs), “a Memorandum of Understanding” (MOUs), and providing other
    relevant documents to ensure compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC)
    regulations. <br />
    Below are the details of each step:

  <br />
  <FiraText>
    The Multi-Stage Sale will be divided into different rounds that will ensure
    that Multichainz’s native token is fairly distributed and decentralized
    since its Token Event Generation (TGE). Each round aims to target the
    acquisition of relevant stakeholders, which will be diverse strategic
    partners to help Multichainz scale and gain mass adoption. From investors to
    social media community members, this staged sale will provide a unique
    opportunity to properly reward early investors, while also including
    community members that deserve to be rewarded at an early stage for their
    community development contributions. Here’s the distribution ofthe
    multi-staged token allocation:

  The token sale described here is not intended for citizens or residents of
  countries where such sales are prohibited or restricted. Multichainz does not
  offer its tokens or services to citizens or residents of any country where
  such offer or sale would be contrary to the local law or regulation.
</FiraText>

<br />

<FiraBold>_Token Vesting Schedule</FiraBold>
<br />
<FiraText>
  Vesting refers to the process in which tokens are released gradually over
  time, rather than all at once. Multichainz has determined a vesting schedule
  with a four-year predetermined timeline for the release of the sold tokens in
  the fundraising procedure. This vesting schedule will ensure a long-term
  strategic collaboration with investors while avoiding token dumps that can
  have the overall Multichainz network, and most importantly, the long-term
  ecosystem development.

While investors might be skeptical to commit funds for five years in a highly
volatile environment, this schedule ensures that the team has and will
continue to have a long-term focus on ecosystem development. In turn, this
long-term commitment speaks about their intent of them to make Multichainz a
trusted, widely adopted, and real-world useful lending service and token.
Since Multichainz understands the difficulty in committing funds to the
blockchain industry nowadays, it commits to providing investors with
appropriate incentives, discounts, and token launch timelines consistent with
the project’s sustainable development. The vesting schedule for each group is
as follows:
