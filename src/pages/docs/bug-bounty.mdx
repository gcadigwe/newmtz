<br />

<FiraText>
At MultichainZ, we prioritize the security and protection of our users. We are pleased to introduce the MultichainZ Bug Bounty Program (the "Program") for our web3.0 lending protocol. This program encourages community members to contribute by identifying and responsibly disclosing bugs or vulnerabilities. By participating in this Program, you have the opportunity to earn rewards and help enhance the security of MultichainZ.

Rewards will be granted based on the severity of the reported bug, with evaluations and rewards reaching up to USD $250, 000.

The specific scope, terms, and rewards are subject to the discretion of our team ("Team").
