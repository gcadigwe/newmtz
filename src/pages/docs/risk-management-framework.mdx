<br />

<MultiWeightDiv

<MultiWeightDiv

<br />

<FiraText>
  It is now possible to set upper limits for supply and borrow on each asset
  reserve by configuring supply and borrow caps (optional). This feature helps
  reduce exposure to specific assets and mitigates risks such as infinite
  minting or manipulation of price oracles.

<FiraText>The liquidation mechanism in the protocol has been enhanced with a variable liquidation close factor, allowing for full liquidation of a position as it approaches insolvency (HF < 0.95).</FiraText>

<br />

<MultiWeightDiv
  title='The Price Oracle sentinel feature'
  subText='primarily caters to Layer 2 solutions and addresses potential downtime of sequencers. It introduces a grace period for liquidations and grants RISK_ADMINS the ability to disable borrowing for a reserve under specific circumstances.'
